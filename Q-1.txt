Q1.Write a simple Banking System program by using OOPs concept where you can get account Holder name balance etc?




ANSWER:




Here's a simple example of a banking system program using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java:

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private String accountHolderName;
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(String accountHolderName, double initialBalance) {
        this.accountHolderName = accountHolderName;
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public String getAccountHolderName() {
        return accountHolderName;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
        System.out.println("Amount deposited: " + amount);
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Amount withdrawn: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("John Doe", 1000.0);
        System.out.println("Account Holder Name: " + account.getAccountHolderName());
        System.out.println("Current Balance: " + account.getBalance());

        account.deposit(500.0);
        account.withdraw(200.0);

        System.out.println("Updated Balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Account Holder Name: John Doe
Current Balance: 1000.0
Amount deposited: 500.0
Amount withdrawn: 200.0
Updated Balance: 1300.0
```

In the above program, the `BankAccount` class represents a bank account. It has private instance variables `accountHolderName` and `balance`, along with methods to interact with the account:

- The constructor is used to initialize the account holder name and initial balance.
- The `getAccountHolderName()` and `getBalance()` methods provide access to the account holder name and balance, respectively.
- The `deposit()` method is used to deposit an amount into the account.
- The `withdraw()` method is used to withdraw an amount from the account, considering the available balance.

In the `main` method, an instance of the `BankAccount` class is created with an account holder name and an initial balance. The account holder name and current balance are displayed. Then, a deposit of 500 and a withdrawal of 200 are made, followed by printing the updated balance.

This program demonstrates the basic functionality of a bank account, allowing you to retrieve the account holder name, check the balance, deposit funds, and withdraw funds.
